We are meeting this semester on Mondays at 12:20-1:10 (online, at least initially). 

## Monday, 24 January 2022

For Monday's Zoom meeting please read two documents that establish the context in which Darwin was developing his ideas—William Paley's faith-based notions of a divine Creator and the fixity of species, and the evolutionary theory of Lamarck (inheritance of acquired characters).

The readings are excerpts only.  Although it might seem like a lot of pages, they are very easy to read and should not take much time.  Please ignore the various red boxes and notes in the Paley document—I added these when I originally read it for some reason or other.
