This semester we are reading classic works in evolutionary biology and systematics. We are meeting this semester on **Mondays at 12:20-1:10** (online, at least initially). 

If you need a permission number for this course, or to be added to the mailing list, contact [Kurt Schwenk](mailto:kurt.schwenk@uconn.edu).

### Monday, 24 January 2022

For Monday's Zoom meeting please read two documents that establish the context in which Darwin was developing his ideas—William Paley's faith-based notions of a divine Creator and the fixity of species, and the evolutionary theory of Lamarck (inheritance of acquired characters).

The readings are excerpts only.  Although it might seem like a lot of pages, they are very easy to read and should not take much time.  Please ignore the various red boxes and notes in the Paley document—I added these when I originally read it for some reason or other.
